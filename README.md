# Used-car-price-prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the prices of used cars. Leveraging the power of linear regression and exploratory data analysis, the system provides accurate price estimates based on parameters such as company name, model name, year of purchase, kilometers driven, and fuel type. 

Key Features:
- Data preprocessing: Cleaning and standardizing dataset for analysis.
- Exploratory data analysis: Visualizing relationships between features and car prices.
- Model development: Implementing linear regression for price prediction.
- Evaluation: Assessing model performance using R-squared score.
- Deployment: Saving the trained model for seamless integration into real-world applications.

Usage:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to explore the project.
4. Interact with the trained model to predict car prices based on input parameters.
